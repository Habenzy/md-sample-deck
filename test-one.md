# This is a Test

- trying out Spectacle
- We'll see if this is just **plug-and-play**
- Or do I need more parsing?

# Another Slide

Here's another slide, I wonder if code blocks will work with this...

We'll figure that out in a bit

# A Third Slide

This one should have an image

# A Different Way

Unfortunately, not so simple as drag and drop. Let's try something slightly different.

On the upside this should actually make it simpler to insert code blocks

Unfortunately Spectacle can't natively parse an array of slides so let's use another plug-in

```js

let code = true

```
